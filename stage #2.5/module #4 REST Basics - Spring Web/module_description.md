# REST Basics - Spring Web

## Basics of RESTful APIs
REST is an API architecture style. It stands for Representational State Transfer (REST). 
RREST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. 
REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, 
simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. Itâ€™s used to fetch or give some information from a web service. 
All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.

## Basic principals of designing REST APIs

### Organize the API design around resources

- **Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths** [TO DO]

- **Use Nesting on Endpoints to Show Relationships** [TO DO]

- **Use Name convention** [TO DO]

### Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods 
[TO DO]

### Conform to HTTP semantics

### Use HTTP response status codes 
[TO DO]

### Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination
[TO DO]

### Handle errors gracefully and return standard error codes
[TO DO]

### Maintain good security practices
[TO DO]

### Cache data to improve performance
